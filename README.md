This is a curated list of **academic** (!) books and papers on
object-oriented programming, which promote "object thinking."
We are looking for papers that go along or disagree with the following
hypothesises from [Elegant Objects](http://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
book series (in order of importance):

  * Objects are not data containers
  * Getters and setters are evil
  * Static methods are evil
  * Objects must be immutable
  * Implementation inheritance is evil
  * NULL is evil
  * Constructors must be code free
  * Type casting (and reflection) is evil
  * Java annotations are evil
  * Interfaces must be small

William R. Cook.
**Object-oriented programming versus abstract data types**.
_Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages: REX School/Workshop Noordwijkerhout_, 1990.
[Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0019443):
> This tutorial collects and elaborates arguments for distinguishing between object-oriented programming and abstract data types.

Tim Rentsch.
**Object Oriented Programming**.
_ACM SIGPLAN Notices_, 17(9), 1982.
[ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/947955.947961):
> "Everyone will be in a favor of OOP. Every manufacturer will promote his products as supporting it. Every manager will pay lip service to it. Every programmer will practice it (differently). And no one will know just what it is."
